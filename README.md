# xek1923x: Hackpad v1
My very first own hackpad! Totally excited to build it together and use it!

## Features:
- 6 keys, 4 of them are arrow keys, the others are customizable keys
- Rotary encoder -> used for volume control!

## PCB
Designing the PCB was easier than expected. I should say that the guide was incredibly well-designed and helped me to get an overall impression of KiCAD.

### Schematic design:

## CAD
Thankfully, Autodesk Fusion is FREE for students :). For the CAD, again, I believe that the guide helped me to figure out how to use the software.

### These are the single elements:

### That's how it'll look like:

## BOM
- 1x XIAO-RP2040-DIP
- 1x EC11 Rotary encoder
- 6x MX-Style switches
  - obviously: 6x Blank DSA keycaps
- 2x SK6812 MINI-E LEDs

## notes
That's it! I had a lot of fun in completing the project and will definitely use my hackpad from now on!
